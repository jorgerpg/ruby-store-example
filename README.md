# Ruby on Rails Learning Project

This project was developed as part of my learning journey with **Ruby on Rails**.
It follows a example provided in the official Ruby on Rails documentation,
serving as a hands-on exercise to understand the framework’s structure, conventions,
and development workflow.

The purpose of this repository is purely educational — to practice concepts such as:

* Creating controllers, views, and routes
* Understanding Rails’ MVC architecture
* Applying conventions over configuration
* Working with generators and basic CRUD operations

**Note:** This code is based on examples from the official [Ruby on Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
and is not intended for production use.
